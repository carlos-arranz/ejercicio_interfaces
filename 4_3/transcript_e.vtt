It's one of those Simpsons jokes that we luckily didn't understand when we were kids.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.320
On May 16, 1999, 30 Minutes was launched over Tokyo,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.560
that in addition to showing us without futuristic culture, androids like sionants

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.480
and what Japanese companies are working on,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.400
He told us this joke that no one understood.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.800
Hello, I know a man from Nantóket.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.400
AND?

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.160
Well, I think the stories about this are greatly exaggerated.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.040
To understand it, we need to know the following.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.440
A Libereak is a well-known style of power in English-speaking countries,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.120
which consists of five rhyming verses according to the AABBA structure.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.960
In the early 1900s this style became very popular,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.600
as people come to support the use of this structure.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.240
Among these nursery rhymes, the one that is perhaps the most famous says this.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.200
Once upon a time there was a man from Nantóket,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.360
whose virile member was so long that he could breastfeed him.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.320
He said with a smile, wiping his chin.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.760
If my ear were a female reproductive organ, I would make love to it.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.240
So what I mean is listen to the protagonist of this nursery rhyme

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.040
and he thinks that his anatomical weakness has been somewhat exaggerated.
