It's one of those Simpsons jokes that we luckily didn't understand when we were kids.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,320
On May 16, 1999, 30 Minutes was launched over Tokyo,

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,560
that in addition to showing us without futuristic culture, androids like sionants

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,480
and what Japanese companies are working on,

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,400
He told us this joke that no one understood.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Hello, I know a man from Nantóket.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,400
AND?

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,160
Well, I think the stories about this are greatly exaggerated.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,040
To understand it, we need to know the following.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,440
A Libereak is a well-known style of power in English-speaking countries,

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,120
which consists of five rhyming verses according to the AABBA structure.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,960
In the early 1900s this style became very popular,

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,600
as people come to support the use of this structure.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,240
Among these nursery rhymes, the one that is perhaps the most famous says this.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,200
Once upon a time there was a man from Nantóket,

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,360
whose virile member was so long that he could breastfeed him.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,320
He said with a smile, wiping his chin.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,760
If my ear were a female reproductive organ, I would make love to it.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,240
So what I mean is listen to the protagonist of this nursery rhyme

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,040
and he thinks that his anatomical weakness has been somewhat exaggerated.
